# Chemical synthesis calculator
This is a Python package for the calculation of the necessary masses of substances for chemical synthesis directly from the reaction string. It includes solutions for all intermidiate steps, including chemical formula parsing, molar mass calculation and reaction balancing with different matrix methods.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher is required

## Installation
Install from pypi:

`pip install chemsynthcalc`

## Usage
### ChemicalFormula class
To create a single chemical formula object: 
```Python
from chemsynthcalc import ChemicalFormula

formula = ChemicalFormula("H2O")
```
Now, we can get properties (declared with `@property` decorator) of this object, which are:

A
: a formula
* `parsed_formula`
: adqfqf
*
