# Chemical synthesis calculator
Python package for calculating the masses of substances required for chemical synthesis directly from the reaction string. It includes solutions for all intermidiate steps, including chemical formula parsing, molar mass calculation and reaction balancing with different matrix methods.

## Example use
Let's say that we need to prepare 3 grams of [YBCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide) by solid-state synthesis from respective carbonates. The reaction string will look something like this (to simplify, let's leave it without oxygen nonstoichiometry):

```Python
from chemsynthcalc import ChemicalReaction

reaction_string = "BaCO3 + Y2(CO3)3 + CuCO3 + O2 → YBa2Cu3O7 + CO2"
```

Now, we can create a chemical reaction object of `ChemicalReaction` class, which will be used in the calculation. We need to specify arguments for our particular case:

```Python

reaction = ChemicalReaction(
    reaction = reaction_string, # our reaction string
    target = 0, # number of target compound in product list
    target_mass = 3, # desired mass of target compound,
    mode = "balance" # mode of coefficients calculations,
)
```

Now, to perform automatic calculation, all we need to do is to put:

```Python
reaction.print_results(print_rounding_order=4) # assuming we use analytical balances with 4 digits presicion
```

And we get our ouput in the console:

```
initial reaction: BaCO3+Y2(CO3)3+CuCO3+O2→YBa2Cu3O7+CO2
reaction matrix:
[[1. 0. 0. 0. 2. 0.]
 [1. 3. 1. 0. 0. 1.]
 [3. 9. 3. 2. 7. 2.]
 [0. 2. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1. 0. 3. 0.]]
mode: balance
coefficients: [8, 2, 12, 1, 4, 26]
normalized coefficients: [2, 0.5, 3, 0.25, 1, 6.5]
balanced by algorithm: inverse
is balanced: True
final reaction: 8BaCO3+2Y2(CO3)3+12CuCO3+O2→4YBa2Cu3O7+26CO2
final reaction normalized: 2BaCO3+0.5Y2(CO3)3+3CuCO3+0.25O2→YBa2Cu3O7+6.5CO2
target: YBa2Cu3O7
BaCO3: M = 197.3380 g/mol, m = 1.7773 g
Y2(CO3)3: M = 357.8360 g/mol, m = 0.8057 g
CuCO3: M = 123.5540 g/mol, m = 1.6692 g
O2: M = 31.9980 g/mol, m = 0.0360 g
YBa2Cu3O7: M = 666.1970 g/mol, m = 3.0000 g
CO2: M = 44.0090 g/mol, m = 1.2882 g
```

Now, we got all masses ready for our planned synthesis!

## Documentation
See the docmentation for detailed functionality and all features of the package.

## Features
* Formula parsing

```Python
from chemsynthcalc import ChemicalFormula

>>>ChemicalFormula("C2H5OH").parsed_formula
{'C': 2.0, 'H': 6.0, 'O': 1.0}
```

* Molar mass calculation

```Python
>>>ChemicalFormula("C2H5OH").molar_mass
46.069
```

* [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_fraction_(chemistry)), [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_fraction), and [oxide](https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/introgeo/studio/examples/minex02.pdf) percent calculations with `mass_percent`, `atomic_percent` and `oxide_percent` properties of `ChemicalFormula`.
* Auto-balancing chemical equations by 4 different matrix methods in `"balance"` mode:

```Python
from chemsynthcalc import ChemicalReaction

reaction_string = "K4Fe(CN)6 + KMnO4 + H2SO4 = KHSO4 + Fe2(SO4)3 + MnSO4 + HNO3 + CO2 + H2O"

>>>ChemicalReaction(reaction_string, mode="balance").final_reaction
"10K4Fe(CN)6+122KMnO4+299H2SO4=162KHSO4+5Fe2(SO4)3+122MnSO4+60HNO3+60CO2+188H2O"
```

* Calculation of masses for user-defined coefficients in `"force"` (calculates regardless of balance) and `"check"` (checks if reaction is balanced by user-defined coefficients) modes.
  
```Python
>>>ChemicalReaction("BaCO3+TiO2=BaTiO3", mode="force").masses #we can drop CO2 product and still get masses in this mode. 
[0.84623961, 0.34248308, 1.0]
```

```Python
>>>ChemicalReaction("2H2+O2=2H2O", mode="check").coefficients #we can be sure that reaction is balanced with our coefficients in this mode
[2, 1, 2]
```
Setting the coefficients directly into `ChemicalReaction` instance:
```Python
>>>reaction = ChemicalReaction("H2+O2=H2O", mode="check")
>>>reaction.coefficients = [2,1,2]
>>>reaction.coefficients
[2, 1, 2]
>>>reaction.is_balanced
True
```
* Calculation of coefficients with `ChemicalReaction.balance_reaction()` method individually by each of 4 different algorithms (inverse, general pseudoinverse, partial pseudoinverse and combinatorial algorithms).
* Export of results of both `ChemicalFormula` and `ChemicalReaction` into .txt file (with `.export_to_txt()`), into JSON object (with `.as_json()`) or JSON file (with `.export_to_json()`).
