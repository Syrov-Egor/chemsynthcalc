abstract={Materials discovery has become significantly facilitated and accelerated by high-throughput ab-initio computations. This ability to rapidly design interesting novel compounds has displaced the materials innovation bottleneck to the development of synthesis routes for the desired material. As there is no a fundamental theory for materials synthesis, one might attempt a data-driven approach for predicting inorganic materials synthesis, but this is impeded by the lack of a comprehensive database containing synthesis processes. To overcome this limitation, we have generated a dataset of ``codified recipes'' for solid-state synthesis automatically extracted from scientific publications. The dataset consists of 19,488 synthesis entries retrieved from 53,538 solid-state synthesis paragraphs by using text mining and natural language processing approaches. Every entry contains information about target material, starting compounds, operations used and their conditions, as well as the balanced chemical equation of the synthesis reaction. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for data mining of various aspects of inorganic materials synthesis.},

               virtue of the solution of a Diophantine matrix equation by using
               of a Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse matrix. The method has been
               tested on several typical chemical equations and found to be
               very successful for the all equations in our extensive balancing
               research. This method, which works successfully without any
               limitations, also has the capability to determine the
               feasibility of a new chemical reaction, and if it is feasible,
               then it will balance the equation. Chemical equations treated
               here possess atoms with fractional oxidation numbers. Also, in

  abstract  = "In this work is induced a new topology of solutions of chemical
               equations by virtue of point-set topology in an abstract
               stoichiometrical space. Subgenerators of this topology are the
               coefficients of chemical reaction. Complex chemical reactions,
               as those of direct reduction of hematite with a carbon, often
               exhibit distinct properties which can be interpreted as higher
               level mathematical structures. Here we used a mathematical model
               that exploits the stoichiometric structure, which can be seen as
               a topology too, to derive an algebraic picture of chemical
               equations. This abstract expression suggests exploring the
               chemical meaning of topological concept. Topological models at
               different levels of realism can be used to generate a large
               number of reaction modifications, with a particular aim to
               determine their general properties. The more abstract the theory
               is, the stronger the cognitive power is.",
